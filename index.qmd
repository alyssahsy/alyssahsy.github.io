::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! 

I am a PhD candidate at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. My current research focus on user behavior and social interactions in online health platforms. 

I am learning using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build this website and write academic and personal blogs (content may be imcomplete or contain errors).

I enjoy reading and watching movies in my spare time.
