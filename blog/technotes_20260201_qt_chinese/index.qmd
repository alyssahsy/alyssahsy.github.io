## Here are two tips for using Quarto to write documents in Chinese and English

### 1. Use .html files for Chinese documents, then export to PDF
```yaml
---
title: "中文PDF文档"
author: "作者姓名"
format: html
---
```
### 2. specify and include Chinese packages in the YAML frontmatter (with additional formatting options)
```yaml
---
title: "中文PDF文档"
author: "作者姓名"

documentclass: article
header-includes:
  - \usepackage[UTF8]{ctex}
pdf-engine: xelatex
geometry:
  - left=2.5cm
  - right=2.5cm
